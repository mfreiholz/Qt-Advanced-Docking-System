## New and Noteworthy

Release [4.1](https://github.com/githubuser0xFFFF/Qt-Advanced-Docking-System/releases/latest) significantly improves the Auto-Hide functionality and also brings improvements 
for Drag and Drop of dock widgets into dock area tabs. These are the highlights of the new version:

#### Drag & Drop to Auto-Hide

Now you can easily drag any dock widget or any floating widget to the
borders of a window to pin it as a auto-hide tab in one of the 4 sidebars.
If you drag a dock widget close the one of the four window borders, special
drop overlays will be shown to indicate the drop area for auto-hide widgets:

![Auo-Hide drag to Sidebar](doc/AutoHide_Drag_to_Sidebar.gif)

Of course, this also works with dock areas:

![Auo-Hide drag Dock Area](doc/AutoHide_Drag_DockArea.gif)

If you drag a dock widget or dock area into a sidebar, then you even have
control over where tabs are inserted. Simply drag your mouse over a specific
auto-hide tab, and your dragged dock widget will be inserted before this tab.
Drag to the sidebar area behind the last tab, and the dragged widget will be
appended as last tab. In the following screen capture, the **Image Viewer 1** will
be inserted before the **Table 0** Auto-Hide tab and the **Image Viewer 2**
is appende behind the last tab:

![Auo-Hide tab insert order](doc/AutoHide_Tab_Insert_Order.gif)

#### Auto-Hide Tab Insertion Order

It is also possible to drag Auto-Hide tabs to a new auto-hide position.
That means, you can drag them to a different border or sidebar:

![Auto-Hide change sidebar](doc/AutoHide_Change_Sidebar.gif)

#### Auto-Hide Tab Sorting

You can drag Auto-Hide tabs to a new position in the current sidebar 
to sort them:

![Auo-Hide sort tabs](doc/AutoHide_Sort_Tabs.gif)

#### Auto-Hide Drag to Float / Dock

But that is not all. You can also simply move Auto-Hide tabs to another
floating widget or dock them via drag and drop:

![Auo-Hide drag to float or dock](doc/AutoHide_Drag_to_Float_or_Dock.gif)

#### Auto-Hide Context Menu

All Auto-Hide tabs now have a context menu, that provides all the functionality
that you know from Dock widget tabs. With the **Pin To...** item from the
context menu it is very easy to move an Auto-Hide tab to a different Auto-Hide
sidebar:

![Auo-Hide context menu](doc/AutoHide_Context_Menu.png)

#### Dock Area Tab Insert Order

And last but not least the new version also improves the docking of widgets
into the tabs of a Dock area. Just as with Auto-Hide tabs, you can now determine the position at which a tab is inserted by moving the mouse over an already existing tab (insertion before the tab) or behind the last tab 
(appending):

![Dock area tab insert order](doc/DockArea_Tab_Insertion_Order.gif)

### Docking everywhere - no central widget

There is no central widget like in the Qt docking system. You can dock on every
border of the main window or you can dock into each dock area - so you are
free to dock almost everywhere.

![Dropping widgets](doc/preview-dragndrop.png)

![Dropping widgets](doc/preview-dragndrop_dark.png)

### Docking inside floating windows

There is no difference between the main window and a floating window. Docking
into floating windows is supported.

![Docking inside floating windows](doc/floating-widget-dragndrop.png)

![Docking inside floating windows](doc/floating-widget-dragndrop_dark.png)

### Grouped dragging

When dragging the titlebar of a dock, all the tabs that are tabbed with it are 
going to be dragged. So you can move complete groups of tabbed widgets into
a floating widget or from one dock area to another one.

![Grouped dragging](doc/grouped-dragging.gif)

![Grouped dragging](doc/grouped-dragging_dark.png)

### Perspectives for fast switching of the complete main window layout

A perspective defines the set and layout of dock windows in the main
window. You can save the current layout of the dockmanager into a named
perspective to make your own custom perspective. Later you can simply
select a perspective from the perspective list to quickly switch the complete 
main window layout.

![Perspective](doc/perspectives.gif)

![Perspective](doc/perspectives_dark.png)

### Opaque and non-opaque splitter resizing

The advanced docking system uses standard QSplitters as resize separators and thus supports opaque and non-opaque resizing functionality of QSplitter. In some rare cases, for very complex widgets or on slow machines resizing via separator on the fly may cause flicking and glaring of rendered content inside a widget. The global dock manager flag `OpaqueSplitterResize` configures the resizing behaviour of the splitters. If this flag is set, then widgets are resized dynamically (opaquely) while interactively moving the splitters.

![Opaque resizing](doc/opaque_resizing.gif)

If this flag is cleared, the widget resizing is deferred until the mouse button is released - this is some kind of lazy resizing separator.

![Non-opaque resizing](doc/non_opaque_resizing.gif)

### Cancelable docking process

In contrast to the standard Qt docking system, docking with the ADS works more like a drag & drop operation. That means, the dragged dock widget or dock area is not undocked immediately. Instead, a drag preview widget is created and dragged around to indicate the future position of the dock widget or dock area. The actual dock operation is only executed when the mouse button is released. That makes it possible, to cancel an active drag operation with the escape key.

The drag preview widget can be configured by a number of global dock manager flags:
- `DragPreviewIsDynamic`: if this flag is enabled, the preview will be adjusted dynamically to the drop area
- `DragPreviewShowsContentPixmap`: the created drag preview window shows a static copy of the content of the dock widget / dock are that is dragged
- `DragPreviewHasWindowFrame`: this flag configures if the drag preview is frameless like a QRubberBand or looks like a real window

### Tab-menu for easy handling of many tabbed dock widgets

Tabs are a good way to quickly switch between dockwidgets in a dockarea. However, if the number of dockwidgets in a dockarea is too large, this may affect the usability of the tab bar. To keep track in this situation, you can use the tab menu. The menu allows you to quickly select the dockwidget you want to activate from a drop down menu.

![Tab menu](doc/tab_menu.gif)

### Many different ways to detach dock widgets

You can detach dock widgets and also dock areas in the following ways:

- by dragging the dock widget tab or the dock area title bar
- by double clicking the tab or title bar
- by using the detach menu entry from the tab and title bar drop down menu

### Supports deletion of dynamically created dock widgets

Normally clicking the close button of a dock widget will just hide the widget and the user can show it again using the toggleView() action of the dock widget. This is meant for user interfaces with a static amount of widgets. But the advanced docking system also supports dynamic dock widgets that will get deleted on close. If you set the dock widget flag `DockWidgetDeleteOnClose` for a certain dock widget, then it will be deleted as soon as you close this dock widget. This enables the implementation of user interfaces with dynamically created editors, like in word processing applications or source code development tools.

### Auto-Hide Functionality

The 4.0 release of ADS added the new **Auto-Hide** feature. Thanks to the
[initial contribution](https://github.com/githubuser0xFFFF/Qt-Advanced-Docking-System/pull/452) by [Ahmad Syarifuddin](https://github.com/SyarifFakhri) it was
possible to close this long standing [feature request](https://github.com/githubuser0xFFFF/Qt-Advanced-Docking-System/issues/147). The "Auto Hide" feature
allows to display more information using less screen space by hiding or showing
windows pinned to one of the four dock container borders.

![Auto-Hide Movie](doc/AutoHide_Movie.gif)

The Advanced Docking
System supports "Auto-Hide" functionality for **all** dock containers - that means,
for the main window and for each floating widget. Here is short list of all
auto hide features:

- supported for the main window and all floating dock containers
- supports showing and hiding via mouse click or mouse hover
- respects opaque / non opaque splitter resizing flag
- context menu for pinning a dock widget or a complete dock area to a certain border
- configuration option to configure if the pin button should pin the current
  dock widget tab or a complete dock area
- click the pin button holding the Ctrl key to pin a complete dock area
- fully CSS styleable
- backward compatible state file format - is is possible to load older dock manager
  state files without auto hide support and older versions can load the new state
  files with Auto-Hide state information

More about the auto hide configuration options in the [online documentation...](doc/user-guide.md#auto-hide-configuration-flags)

## Python Bindings

![Python Logo](doc/python_logo.png)

Thanks to the contribution of several users, the Advanced Docking System comes
with a complete Python integration. Python bindings are available for **PyQt5** and
**PySide6**.

### PySide6

A PySide6 ADS package is available via PyPi and can be installed on Windows,
macOS, and Linux with:

```bash
pip install PySide6-QtAds
```

Sample code is available [here](https://github.com/mborgerson/Qt-Advanced-Docking-System/tree/pyside6/examples). To run the samples, you'll also need to install latest qtpy
from source (pip install https://github.com/spyder-ide/qtpy/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
The PySide6 bindings were contributed by:

- [mborgerson](https://github.com/mborgerson)

Please file PySide6-QtAds-specific issues on its [pyside6_qtads](https://github.com/mborgerson/pyside6_qtads) fork for tracking. For more information about the PySide6 bindings read [this](https://github.com/githubuser0xFFFF/Qt-Advanced-Docking-System/issues/298) issue.

### PyQt5

A package is available via [conda-forge](https://github.com/conda-forge/pyqtads-feedstock).

## Tested Compatible Environments

### Supported Qt Versions

The library supports **Qt5** and **Qt6**.

### Windows

Windows 10 [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/qcfb3cy932jw9mpy/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/githubuser0xFFFF/qt-advanced-docking-system/branch/master)

The library was developed on and for Windows. It is used in a commercial Windows application and is therefore constantly tested.

### macOS

macOS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/githubuser0xFFFF/Qt-Advanced-Docking-System.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/githubuser0xFFFF/Qt-Advanced-Docking-System)

The application can be compiled for macOS. A user reported, that the library works on macOS. If have not tested it.

![Advanced Docking on macOS](doc/macos.png)

### Linux

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/githubuser0xFFFF/Qt-Advanced-Docking-System.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/githubuser0xFFFF/Qt-Advanced-Docking-System)
[![Build status](https://github.com/githubuser0xFFFF/Qt-Advanced-Docking-System/workflows/linux-builds/badge.svg)](https://github.com/githubuser0xFFFF/Qt-Advanced-Docking-System/actions?query=workflow%3Alinux-builds)

Unfortunately, there is no such thing as a Linux operating system. Linux is a heterogeneous environment with a variety of different distributions. So it is not possible to support "Linux" like it is possible for Windows. It is only possible to support and test a small subset of Linux distributions. The library can be compiled for and has been developed and tested with some Linux distributions. Depending on the used window manager or compositor, dock widgets
with native title bars are supported or not. If native title bars are not supported,
the library switches to `QWidget` based title bars.

- **Kubuntu 18.04 and 19.10** - uses KWin - no native title bars
- **Ubuntu 18.04, 19.10 and 20.04** - native title bars are supported
- **Ubuntu 22.04** - uses Wayland -> no native title bars

There are some requirements for the Linux distribution that have to be met:

- an X server that supports ARGB visuals and a compositing window manager. This is required to display the translucent dock overlays ([https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html#creating-translucent-windows](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html#creating-translucent-windows)). If your Linux distribution does not support this, or if you disable this feature, you will very likely see issue [#95](https://github.com/githubuser0xFFFF/Qt-Advanced-Docking-System/issues/95).
- Wayland is not properly supported by Qt yet. If you use Wayland, then you should set the session type to x11: `XDG_SESSION_TYPE=x11 ./AdvancedDockingSystemDemo`. You will find more details about this in issue [#288](https://github.com/githubuser0xFFFF/Qt-Advanced-Docking-System/issues/288).

Screenshot Ubuntu:
![Advanced Docking on Ubuntu Linux](doc/linux_ubuntu_1910.png)

## Build

The Linux build requires private header files. Make sure that they are installed.
The library uses SVG icons, so ensure that Qt SVG support is installed. The demo
application creates a `QQuickWidget` for testing, so ensure that the required
libraries are installed.

### Qt5 on Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04

```bash
sudo apt install qt5-default qtbase5-private-dev
```

### Qt5 on Ubuntu 22.04

```bash
sudo apt install qtbase5-dev qtbase5-private-dev qtbase5-dev-tools libqt5svg5 libqt5qml5 qtdeclarative5-dev
```

### Qt6 on Ubuntu 22.04

```bash
sudo apt install qt6-default qt6-base-dev qt6-base-private-dev qt6-tools-dev libqt6svg6 qt6-qtdeclarative
```

Open the `ads.pro` file with QtCreator and start the build, that's it.
You can run the demo project and test it yourself.

## Getting started / Example

The following example shows the minimum code required to use the advanced Qt docking system.

*MainWindow.h*

```cpp
#include <QMainWindow>
#include "DockManager.h"

namespace Ui {
class MainWindow;
}

class MainWindow : public QMainWindow
{
    Q_OBJECT

public:
    explicit MainWindow(QWidget *parent = 0);
    ~MainWindow();

private:
    Ui::MainWindow *ui;
    
    // The main container for docking
    ads::CDockManager* m_DockManager;
};
```

*MainWindow.cpp*

```cpp
#include "MainWindow.h"
#include "ui_MainWindow.h"

#include <QLabel>

MainWindow::MainWindow(QWidget *parent) :
    QMainWindow(parent),
    ui(new Ui::MainWindow)
{
    ui->setupUi(this);

    // Create the dock manager after the ui is setup. Because the
    // parent parameter is a QMainWindow the dock manager registers
    // itself as the central widget as such the ui must be set up first.
    m_DockManager = new ads::CDockManager(this);

    // Create example content label - this can be any application specific
    // widget
    QLabel* l = new QLabel();
    l->setWordWrap(true);
    l->setAlignment(Qt::AlignTop | Qt::AlignLeft);
    l->setText("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. ");

    // Create a dock widget with the title Label 1 and set the created label
    // as the dock widget content
    ads::CDockWidget* DockWidget = new ads::CDockWidget("Label 1");
    DockWidget->setWidget(l);

    // Add the toggleViewAction of the dock widget to the menu to give
    // the user the possibility to show the dock widget if it has been closed
    ui->menuView->addAction(DockWidget->toggleViewAction());

    // Add the dock widget to the top dock widget area
    m_DockManager->addDockWidget(ads::TopDockWidgetArea, DockWidget);
}

MainWindow::~MainWindow()
{
    delete ui;
}
```
